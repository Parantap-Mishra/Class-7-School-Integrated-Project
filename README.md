# 📚 Class 7 Integrated Project

Welcome to my Class 7 Integrated School Project — one of my very first attempts at building a webpage using HTML and basic CSS!

## 🧠 Overview

This project was a part of my school's integrated curriculum, where we had to come up with a unique product and combine multiple subjects into a single, cohesive digital presentation. Each subject had its own section, and the whole project was hosted as a website.

> ✨ I created this in **Class 7** — back when I was just starting to explore the world of coding and design. Looking back at this now, it's a reminder of how early my interest in tech and development began!

## 💡 Purpose

- Integrate learnings from various academic subjects (Math, Science, SST, etc.)
- Present the topics in an interactive and engaging digital format
- Encourage creative thinking and basic tech skills among students

## 🛠️ How It Was Built

- **HTML:** Structured the content of each subject section.
- **CSS:** Basic styling to make the content readable and clean.

This was before I learned about responsiveness, optimization, or frameworks — it was pure beginner enthusiasm and curiosity!


## 🌱 Why This Matters

While it might look simple today, this was a big step for me back then. It sparked a love for web development and problem-solving, and marked the beginning of my coding journey.

I’ve come a long way since then — exploring Python, AI, UI/UX, full-stack projects, and startups — but this project will always be special.

## 🔭 What's Next

This is an archived project — I don't plan to update it further. But I'm working on much more complex and creative tech projects now. You can follow my journey [here](https://github.com/parantap-mishra).

## 🙌 Final Note

If you're just getting started with coding like I was back then — *keep building, keep exploring*. Projects like these may seem small, but they are powerful stepping stones.
