    <p class="p" id="intro">E-commerce, also known as electronic commerce or internet commerce, refers to the buying and selling of
      goods or services using the internet, and the transfer of money and data to execute these transactions.
      Ecommerce is often used to refer to the sale of physical products online, but it can also describe any
      kind of commercial transaction that is facilitated through the internet. These business transactions
      occur either as business-to-business (B2B), business-to-consumer (B2C), consumer-to-consumer(C2C) or
      consumer-to-business(C2B).</p></div>

      <p class="p">Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a contagious disease caused by the severe acute respiratory
        syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus. The first known case was identified in Wuhan, China, in
        December 2019. The WHO declared the outbreak a Pandemic on 11 March.</p>

      <p class="p">The virus that causes COVID-19 spreads mainly when an infected person is in close contact with another
        person. Small droplets and aerosols containing the virus can spread from an infected person's nose and
        mouth as they breathe, cough, sneeze, sing, or speak. Other people are infected if the virus gets into
        their mouth, nose or eyes. The virus may also spread via contaminated surfaces, although this is not
        thought to be the main route of transmission.</p>

      <img id="ec" src="images/e on c.jpg">
      <p class="p">It has been more than 13 months that the world is at a standstill and grappling due to COVID-19
        pandemic. It had forced the whole world into a lockdown.<br> It has threatened the livelihood of
        humans and severely effected businesses, especially the small and unorganized sector. Lockdown, social distancing and work from home have become
        the new normal.</p>

        <p class="p">The lockdown resulted in the supply chains being disturbed and many shops were closed for long durations. People resorted to purchasing goods online which led to e-commerce businesses undergoing a drastic change. The convenience it afforded caused people to increase online transactions and many crossed the digital divide. They also did not have to <br>expose themselves by going out and buying goods.</p>
